## Inspiration/Credits
The implementation is also inspired by [Latest-News-Classifier](https://github.com/miguelfzafra/Latest-News-Classifier). Kindly visit this repository to have a more detailed understanding of the feature Engineering and Machine Learning Model training part. 

## Overview

The project is an Event Recommendation System developed with the help of Natural Langauge Processing and Machine Learning Technology. The recommender system will take an input event string as a csv file and based on the trained model it will predict itâ€™s domain and event type along with the names of the employees who might be interested in the domain. The dataset used for training the machine learning model is collected through various fields like Coursera, event websites, emails. It has around 258 entries. The employee data was provided from which we are predicting the results are a collection of 185 entries. We have used TFIDF Algorithm for feature extraction and Random Forest Classifier for the domain and event type prediction.

For More details on understanding the problem statement and implementation part you can refer the [Project Report](https://github.com/trystine/Event-Recommendation-System-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning/blob/main/documentation/ProjectReport.doc)
